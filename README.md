## About This Portfolio

Due to corporate restrictions, live Power BI reports cannot be shared publicly. Instead, this repository includes screenshots and detailed READMEs for each dashboard. For inquiries or private demonstrations, feel free to contact me.

Thanks to Barousse for the excellent course that inspired these projects.
