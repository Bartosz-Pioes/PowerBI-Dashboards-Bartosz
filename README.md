# Power BI Dashboards by Bartosz Józefowicz

These dashboards were created by me based on learning's course.  
These are my own efforts showcasing my understanding and implementation of the material.  
Since the original `.pbix` files exceed GitHub’s 25 MB limit, I am sharing screenshots below along with links to the live reports hosted on Power BI Service.
